        <h2> You've made it to Melboune, Australia but you don't see clarke. You assume he took the flight to Iceland. When you step off your plane the flight attendant hands you a note that tells your your next clue would be found in Luna Park and there's a car waiting for you outside. You get to the park and a woman is outside the entrance holding a poster with your name onit. You go over to her and she welcomes you to Melbourne and hands you a fast pass to all of the rides. After a long and exciting day, she asks where you'd like to go next.</h2>
