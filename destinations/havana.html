    <h1> Oye que bola? You have arrived in Havana, Cuba.</h1>
     <p> You have just touched down at Jose Marti International Airport and you hit the ground running. 
       There are only two days to find the winning ticket. You head to Havana Vieja, which means Old Havana. 
       This is a neighborhood in the city that is famous for its beautiful architecture, bright colors, and rich cultural heritage. 
       You stop to watch a street musician play some Cuban-style jazz. At the end of his song, he flips his hat off 
       toward you, and inside the hat lies your next clue! It reads, "Head to the Monte de las Banderas. 
       There, waving proudly like a flag, you will find what you seek." You hop right into a bright-blue, old-school 
       car from the 1950s, and head straight to the water.  All 138 flags of the Wall of Flags are waving 
       in the wind and you spot the golden envelope at the very top of the flagpole in the center. 
      You have found your final ticket! All you need to do is head to San Francisco, California.</p>
