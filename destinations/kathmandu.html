        <h2> You've made it to Kathmandu. Stepping into the city, you're greeted with a melting pot of cultures and people. The building look very ancient and many people are walking the streets. Your first stop is to Budahnilkantha, a Buddhist shrine of the sleping Vishnu, and pray for your luck and fortune in this journey. Next, you catch a flight around the Himalayan Mountains and capture their intense beauty. From there, you relax in the city and try new cuisine by the locals. While eating you begin to plan where your trip will take you next. </h2>
