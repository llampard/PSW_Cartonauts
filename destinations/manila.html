        <h2> You decided to go to Manila. With onlt 6 days left, you pray that Clarke didn't beat you to it. You reach Manila and stepping out of theairport, you can't help but realize the amount of people. Nearly 1.8 million people live in Manila alone! You get on a ____ and head to Fort Santiago, a historic citadel and memorial site. While arriving there you lock eyes with Clarke. The two of you run to the Andr√©s Bonifacio Monument. We both reached for the note and you reached it first. The note read "Congratulation,s you're the winner of Around the World in 80 Days!" </h2>
