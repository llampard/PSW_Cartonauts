        <h1>Kumusta? Tag along to Manila.</h1>
        <h2>You decided to go to Manila. With only 6 days left, you pray that Clarke didn't beat you to it. You reach Manila and stepping out of the airport, you can't help but realize the number of people. Nearly 1.8 million people live in Manila alone! You get on a crowded Jeepney, a kitschy and brightly decorated bus-like vehicle, and head to Fort Santiago, a historic citadel and memorial site. As soon as you step off of the Jeepney, you find yourself locking eyes with Clarke. The two of you run to the Andr√©s Bonifacio Monument. We both reached for the envelope and you reached it first. There you find your final ticket! All you need to do is head to San Francisco, USA, where you started your race.</h2>
